# CDN Practical — Upload & Test

This repository contains a small HTTP/2 demo site for your CDN practical. Follow the steps below to create a GitHub repository and push the project so you can present your work.

Steps to upload your practical to GitHub

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g. "cdn-practical").
2. From your project root run the following commands (replace values where noted):

```bash
# initialize git (if not already)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: CDN practical"
# create remote (replace <username> and <repo>)
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/cdn-practical.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

3. After pushing, update the GitHub link in `html/index.html` to point to your repository so the demo page links out to it.

That's it — your practical will be on GitHub and ready to show.
